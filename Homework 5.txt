1. Which of the followings is considered boxing? C
a. double dblx = fx;
b. float fx = ix;
c. object myobjx = fx;
d. int ix = objy;

2. Which of the followings is considered unboxing? B
a. string str = ix.ToString();
b. double dblx =(double) fx;
c. object myobjx = fx;
d. int ix = (int) objy;

3. Object objdblx is of type double. Assign the value of this object to a variable of type float.
float fx = (float)(double)objdblx;

4. Object objflx is of type float. Assign the value of this object o another variable of type double.
double dx = (double)objflx;

5. Convert the string strx to a double dblx:
double dblx = (double)strx;

6. Convert the integer ix to a float fx:
float fx = ix;

7. Convert the double dblx to a string strx:
string strx = dblx.ToString();

8. Object is the          base        class of all other data types.
9. What is an object (the definition)? 

10. How do you declare an object in C#? 
string y = "test";
